## 🎨 Styling Guidelines

ReplyRocket is built with **shadcn/ui**, powered by **Tailwind CSS** and **Radix UI**.

**Key styling rules:**
1. **Tailwind First** — Use Tailwind utility classes instead of inline styles or separate CSS files.
2. **shadcn/ui Components** — Use pre-built components for consistent design and accessibility.
3. **Radix UI Awareness** — Understand Radix UI’s headless architecture for custom components.
4. **Centralized Theming** — Configure themes in `tailwind.config.ts`.
5. **Responsive Design** — Use Tailwind’s responsive classes to ensure cross-device compatibility.
6. **Accessibility** — Follow semantic HTML and ARIA best practices.
7. **Consistent Formatting** — Use **Prettier** for code formatting.
